Hello! ðŸ‘‹
## What is The Obsolete Marketer? ##
The Obsolete Marketer gives you the roadmap to expedite marketing tasks with AI-based tech.

Most of the content is hands-on and immediately usable by you as a set of instructions. The sites providing high-level reviews never helped much in actually adopting the tools in everyday workflows.

Hopefully this will be a welcome change.
## Is it free? ##
The advice is, but some of the tools I use might not be. I will try to use the free options whenever they are suitable.

To keep it genuine I don't use any affiliate links on this website.
## Who are you? ##
I'm Raitis (pronounced _right is_). A proper marketing generalist.

As a result I often find myself working in early stage startups where one has to do all sorts of marketing tasks. It's interesting, but taxing.

In any marketing discipline there's never a lack of things to do, but once you have to do way more than one, you're at the state of constant trade-offs.

This is why I've started looking into tools and techniques to get more done.

I won't be getting into time management advice as there's plenty of that online and will instead focus on offsetting the amount of work with AI and other technology that might one day replace us in our jobs.

Or should I say _will replace_?
