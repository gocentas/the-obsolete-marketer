Software and AI is getting better at a faster rate than humans are so this post will likely age badly.

With that in mind, you, as a marketer can feel relatively safe given that you match one or more of these conditions.

## The First Condition - You're Producing Novel Ideas ##
AI has to learn on a subset of data to be able to generate something _new_.

However, this _new_ thing is just a derivative of many other things. While one might argue that humans also produce nothing more than remixes of other ideas, we go further than that by making conclusions and interpretations of the data provided.

Hence, we come up with something novel, maybe even radical once in while. In the meantime AI is still remixing the learning data in different ways.
## The Second Condition - Your Work is Complex ##
As is usual with automation and AI, simple, single-faceted, repetitive tasks get replaced first. If your tasks aren't systematic and clear-cut, you should be fine for now.

For example if you're just writing Instagram post descriptions - you're in trouble. If you're styling the entire feed, taking pictures, writing descriptions, selecting hashtags, and tagging people - it's within reach, but might take a while and isn't really worth automating now.
## The Third Condition - You Are Underpaid ##
Let's face it. The more you earn, the more compelling it is to replace you with a machine.

One of the best examples is Github's Copilot. Software engineers are in high demand and expensive to hire even at a Junior level. Copilot and similar solutions behind closed doors are reducing the need for Junior level employees in best paid industries.

This last thing brings up an interesting paradigm though. At some point we will see a decrease in experienced engineers just because there was less space for newcomers to gain that experience with automation replacing parts of their role.

It's for you to decide where this will lead us.
